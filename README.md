# Leada-R-Project-2-Ebola

For this assignment, you should pick a specific country in the African data, and focus on creating relevant visualizations for that specific country: https://github.com/tristantao/ebola
 
Here are the steps required.
 
Step 1. Aggregation
The individual datasets are separately prepared (for example): https://github.com/tristantao/ebola/tree/master/liberia_data
You'll need to either aggregate the individual CSVs into a single workable dataset.
 
Step 2. Visualization
Build visualizations for the aggregated data. There are different visualizations you can build (a line graph is a good start). Also, there are different variables you can visualize (Total death/s in confirmed cases, New Case/s (Probable), total confirmed cases, and a lot more). Think about which variables might be interesting / meaningful. You're also free to find additional data (geographical data etc), but make sure you cite your sources!
 
There are some sample visualizations here: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28755033
 
Step 3. Conclusion
So you got the data and built some visualizations. Now interpret it! Note a few things about the graph. Can you conclude anything? Is the worst over? Maybe it's yet to come? Or not enough data? Let us know your thoughts.
